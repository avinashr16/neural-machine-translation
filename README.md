# Neural-Machine-Translation with Transformers - Engllish to Tamil 
In this project, we focus on implementing a state-of-the-art NMT system specifically designed to translate English sentences into Tamil, a Dravidian language spoken predominantly in South India and Sri Lanka. 

* We have used the transformers architecture , by trying t0 replicate the papper "Attention is all you need" which deals with the task of translating english to german . 
* The model we have made is a character level model with 4 Encoder and 4 Decoder Layers (21 million params)
